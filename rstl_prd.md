# RSTL Appointment Portal - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

### Purpose
Develop an efficient and organized appointment scheduling portal for RSTL, managing appointments for three laboratories: Metrology Lab, Specimens (Microbiology) Lab, and Chemistry Lab. The platform streamlines appointment booking, client and company registration, and administrative management tasks.

### Scope

**Included:**
- Appointment scheduling interfaces for Metrology, Specimens, and Chemistry labs.
- Administrative interfaces for managing client data, appointments, and reporting.
- Specific pipelines for user interactions per laboratory.

**Excluded:**
- User registration/authentication (no client userbase; data entry via public forms).
- Payment processing unless specified explicitly.

### Objectives
- Automate appointment scheduling and management processes.
- Ensure data integrity and efficient administrative oversight.
- Maintain laboratory-specific constraints and requirements.

### Audience & Stakeholders
- **Clients/Users:** Company managers and truck drivers for Metrology; general clients for Specimens and Chemistry labs.
- **Admins:** Laboratory staff managing appointments and client data.
- **Developers:** Technical teams maintaining the system.

## 2. Core Functionalities

### Metrology Lab Pipeline

**User Pipeline:**
- **Company Registration (Manager):**
  - Form requiring company details, business permit, ORCR, and license plate information.
  - Data validation for submitted documents.
  - Registration data initially marked as "pending verification."

- **Truck Appointment Scheduling (Driver):**
  - Form includes truck license plate verification against registered plates.
  - Input for liquid carried (liters).
  - Appointment scheduling constrained by:
    - Maximum daily capacity (80,000 liters).
    - Slot limits per day (admin configurable).
    - First-booked, first-served logic.

**Admin Pipeline:**
- Comprehensive dashboard including:
  - Company and truck registration management.
  - Interface for verifying and approving/rejecting manager-submitted company data.
  - Daily appointment view and editing.
  - Configurable constraints management (slots, daily liter capacity).

### Specimens (Microbiology) & Chemistry Lab Pipeline

**User Pipeline:**
- Clients fill out public web forms for appointment scheduling and sample submission.
- Form responses logged with timestamps and mapped to the database.

**Admin Pipeline:**
- Centralized admin dashboard displaying:
  - Form responses (searchable, sortable).
  - Data management with editable fields.
  - Mapped values and relationships across tables.
  - Comprehensive reporting and export functionality.

## 3. Implementation Notes

### Technical Stack

- **Front End**
  - Flask (web framework)
  - WTForms (form handling and validation)
  - Jinja2 (templating and dynamic HTML)
  - Bootstrap (styling)
  - JavaScript (interactivity) + DataTables.js (interactive, editable tables)

- **Back End**
  - Flask (core framework)
  - SQLAlchemy (ORM for database interactions)
  - PostgreSQL (database)
  - Flask Micromodules:
    - Flask-Migrate
    - Flask-Login
    - Flask-WTF
    - Flask-SQLAlchemy
  - Others:
    - Pandas (data manipulation)
    - ReportLab (PDF generation)
    - OpenPyXL (Excel exports)

- **AJAX & APIs**
  - Flask routes handling AJAX requests and responding with JSON
  - RESTful CRUD API endpoints

- **Deployment**
  - Docker
  - Gunicorn
  - Nginx

### Assumptions & Constraints
- No client login required; all interactions via public forms.
- Document uploads (ORCR, business permits) securely stored.
- Maximum daily capacities and appointment constraints strictly enforced.
- Compliance with standard web security practices (OWASP, GDPR).

### Risks & Dependencies
- High concurrency handling required for daily bookings.
- Document verification and management system dependencies.
- Email notifications (SMTP) required for appointment confirmations.
